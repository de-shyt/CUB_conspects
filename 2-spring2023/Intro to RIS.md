### Sections of mechanics

**Statics** is concerned with the analysis of loads (force and torque, or "moment") acting on physical systems that do not experience an acceleration (a=0), but rather, are in static equilibrium with their environment.

**Kinematics** describes the motion of points, bodies (objects), and systems of bodies (groups of objects) without considering properties of objects (mass, density) or the forces that caused the motion.

**Kinetics** is concerned with the relationship between motion and its causes, specifically, forces and torques.
