### Cyborgs

**Cyborg** is a being that combines both organic and artificial components to enhance its capabilities. Cochlear implants, prosthetic limbs (not all) make a person to be a cyborg. Examples from sci-fi are Terminator, Darth Vader 

There is an opinion that people wearing glasses are not considered cyborgs. The term "cyborg" is often reserved for augmentations that involve electronic components. Glasses are relatively simple optical aids that correct or enhance vision without integrating electronic elements directly into the body. So people wearing glasses are not cyborgs :(





### Isaac Asimov

**Isaac Asimov** is a science-fiction writer. He wrote numerous novels, short stories, and essays that had a profound impact on the genre. Moreover, he studied chemistry. 

Asimov was from Russian-Jewish family. He was born in Petrovichi, Russia. Then his family immigrated to the United States when he was a young child, and he grew up in Brooklyn, New York. Asimov spoke Yiddish, English and German, but never Russian.

A well-known series by Asimov is the Robot series, which introduced the famous **Three Laws of Robotics**:

1. A robot may not injure a human being or, through inaction, allow a human being to come to harm.
2. A robot must obey the orders given it by human beings except where such orders would conflict with the First Law.
3. A robot must protect its own existence as long as such protection does not conflict with the First or Second Law.

Later, Asimov added a fourth law, but realized it should have precedence over the other three, so it is the **Zeroth Law**:

- A robot may not harm humanity, or, by inaction, allow humanity to come to harm.





### Zeerust

The term **zeerust** refers to the datedness of smth in the part, that intended in its time to be futuristic, but becomes outdated as time goes on. It is a thing that was predicte to occur in the future, but did not actually come to fruition in the way they were imagined. The example is flying cars (it was a futuristic prediction in the past; nowadays cars are progressing, but they are far from what was imagined). 

The related term is **skeuomorph**. It is a derivative object that retains attributes from earlier iterations of the object, that were necessary in the original but are no longer so. The example is the electric light bulb imitating the shape of candle flames.
